```

## 🚀 Features
- Clean, reproducible structure
- All code under `src/`

- Sample data under `data/`

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ra-submission-aravind.git
cd ra-submission-aravind
```

### 2) Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the primary entry point (update the filename if different):
```bash
python src/main.py
```

If you use notebooks, start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

## 📊 Data
- Place small/sample datasets in `data/`.  
- For large datasets, add a note here explaining how to obtain them (URL, drive link, etc.), and **avoid committing large files**.

## 🧪 Reproducibility
- Set a random seed where applicable.
- Keep raw data immutable; write outputs to a separate folder if needed (e.g., `outputs/`).

## 🔁 How to Upload / Update on GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project upload"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/ra-submission-aravind.git
